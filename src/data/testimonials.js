		description: `"The Reel Start experience allows kids to understand that their own ideas can come to life. Most of the time, kids believe that they can't contribute to the medium and they are only an audience member. Instead, this program gives them the power. From table reads to shotlists, it\'s an inclusive exercise."`,

			'"Everything done in the program has been extremely remarkable for me… Individuals like Evan, Ethan, Suzy, and Khiry helped us while out of our comfort zone at one point. I’ve enjoyed the first meeting the most since we get a summed up explanation of the whole program and we meet the people we will be working with for quite a while. We also leave feeling encouraged, motivated, and thrilled!"',

			'"My favorite part from the Reel Start Program would have to be the people that i have met. Every guest and member of the team that I’ve met has been extremely passionate about what they do. They make me want to go into television and film. Getting to talk to the second AD Arielle and the BTS guys opened my eyes to different jobs within the industry. You can really see that people love their jobs which isn’t always the case."',

			'"...the greatest part of my involvement is to see when a student sees that there are so many different aspects of the filmmaking process and then wants to participate in it.  When they realize that there are a number of ways that they could see this as a real concrete opportunity.  We had a number of students join us to participate in the Art Department roles of the projects. I could see them using both their creative and organizational skills on a film project for the first time. This gave me great joy."',
