Most of the time, kids believe that they can't contribute to the medium and they are only an audience member. Instead, this program gives them the power. From table reads to shotlists, it\'s an inclusive exercise."`,

When they realize that there are a number of ways that they could see this as a real concrete opportunity.  We had a number of students join us to participate in the Art Department roles of the projects. I could see them using both their creative and organizational skills on a film project for the first time. This gave me great joy."',

Every chance I get I find myself looking through all of the notes, photos, and videos of everything, and I just find it incredible to believe that we all made a short film! This is definitely something that I will remember for many years to come."',

Every guest and member of the team that I’ve met has been extremely passionate about what they do. They make me want to go into television and film. Getting to talk to the second AD Arielle and the BTS guys opened my eyes to different jobs within the industry. You can really see that people love their jobs which isn’t always the case."',
